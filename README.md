# User Experience

## Wireframes

Responsive elements were adding during the design process, and future development would include mobile wireframes to improve responsive design accross the site.

## Design Choices

* ### Fonts
    The font selected for the webiste is Georgia to provide a academic look to the site. This will fall back to Times New Roman and Serif sequentially.

[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Colour
    The colour scheme used is #ffebcd as a base background colour, with rgba(0, 0, 128, 0.9) for secondary backgrounds and borders. This is to provide a warm screen for pleasent user experience while maintaining good contrast. Text uses rgba(0, 0, 128, 1) (navy keyword) to achieve full contrast. Containers and aside columns use ##ffe5b to stand out against the background colour.
